 #### 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Develop a speech-to-speech conversational agent for domain-specific tasks.
- **Components**:
  1. Speech-to-text conversion using the MMS model.
  2. Translation of text to English using IndicTrans2 model.
  3. Context understanding and response generation using a Large Language Model (LLM).

#### 2. System Architecture
1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**:
    - Use MMS model to convert speech in Indic languages to text.

2. **Translation to English**:
    - Use IndicTrans2 model to translate text from Indic languages to English.

3. **Context Understanding and Response Generation**:
    - Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to understand the context and generate responses.

4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:
    - Convert the response back to speech using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model.

5. **Deployment**:
    - Develop an interactive application using Gradio for user interaction.


### Conclusion
- Successfully created a speech-to-speech conversational agent for domain-specific tasks.
- The system converts speech in Indic languages to text, translates it to English, generates a response using a Large Language Model, and converts the response back to speech.
- An interactive application is developed using Gradio for user interaction.

### Future Work
- Expand to include more Indic languages.
- Improve the models and fine-tune them for specific domains.
- Add more sophisticated error handling and user interface enhancements.
