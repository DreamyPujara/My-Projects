#### 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Develop a system to detect events from news articles in Indian languages and classify them into natural and man-made events.
- **Target Languages**: Hindi, Gujarati, Bangla
- **Goal**: Achieve an accuracy of 95.2% in classification.

#### 2. System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**:
    - Collect news articles in Hindi, Gujarati, and Bangla.
    - Label events in the articles as natural or man-made.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Normalize and tokenize text data.
    - Translate articles to a common language (e.g., English) for uniform processing using a translation model.

3. **Model Training**:
    - Use transformer-based models (like BERT, RoBERTa) for text classification.
    - Fine-tune pre-trained models on the labeled dataset.

4. **Event Detection**:
    - Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify potential events in the articles.
    - Classify identified events into natural and man-made using the trained classifier.

5. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Deployment**:
    - Develop an interactive application using Gradio to input news articles and get event classification.
