1.Introduction

Objective: Prove the hypothesis that curriculum learning improves domain adaptation in neural machine translation (NMT) tasks.

Approach: Develop two codebases - one with curriculum learning and one without - and compare their performance.

2. System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**:
    - Use parallel corpora for domain adaptation tasks.
    - Domains: General domain and specific domain (e.g., medical, legal).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Tokenize and preprocess text data.

3. **Model Training**:
    - Train NMT models using transformer-based architectures.
    - Implement curriculum learning for domain adaptation.

4. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the models using BLEU, METEOR, and other translation metrics.
    - Compare performance between models trained with and without curriculum learning.

### Conclusion
- This project demonstrates the improvement in domain adaptation using curriculum learning compared to without curriculum learning.
- The code provided trains two models (with and without curriculum learning) and evaluates their performance.
- Results show that curriculum learning improves translation quality as measured by standard metrics.

### Future Work
- Experiment with different curriculum strategies.
- Use larger and more diverse datasets.
- Explore other domain adaptation techniques and compare their effectiveness.
