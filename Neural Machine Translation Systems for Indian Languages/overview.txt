#### 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Develop a neural machine translation (NMT) system for translating between English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Bangla.
- **Components**:
  1. Text-to-Text Translation
  2. Evaluation Platform for Translation Accuracy
  3. Speech-to-Speech Translation Application using Gradio

#### 2. System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**:
    - Collect parallel corpora for English-Hindi, English-Gujarati, and English-Bangla from available datasets like the IIT Bombay English-Hindi Corpus, OPUS, and others.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Use transformer-based models (like MarianMT, T5, or mBART) for training the NMT systems.
    - Fine-tune pre-trained models on the collected parallel corpora.

3. **Text-to-Text Translation**:
    - Develop NMT models using libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers.
    - Train separate models for English-Hindi, English-Gujarati, and English-Bangla translations.

4. **Evaluation Platform**:
    - Create a platform to evaluate the translation accuracy using metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and TER.
    - Allow users to input sentences and compare model translations with reference translations.

5. **Speech-to-Speech Translation Application**:
    - Use ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) for speech-to-text conversion.
    - Use the trained NMT models for text translation.
    - Use TTS (Text-to-Speech) for text-to-speech conversion.
    - Integrate these components using Gradio for an interactive interface.


 4. Conclusion
- Successfully created a multilingual NMT system for English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Bangla.
- Developed an evaluation platform to measure translation accuracy.
- Built an interactive speech-to-speech translation application using Gradio.

#### 5. Future Work
- Expand the translation capabilities to more languages.
- Improve translation accuracy with larger datasets and more advanced models.
- Integrate more robust ASR and TTS systems.
